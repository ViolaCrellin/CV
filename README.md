#### Who I Am

I’m the unlikely love child of Daria Morgendorffer and Alice in Wonderland - a rare breed of black sheep cynicism crossed with wide-eyed wonder and innocent curiosity. 

Like 0.8% of the population, I’m a female INTJ. I’m a right-brained left-brain. I view the world like a game of chess and automatically deduce order from chaos. I live for solving problems. The more difficult the problem and the more terse it's solution, the better.

Like 0.0002% of the population, I’m a Cambridge graduate with ADHD. I make lateral mental leaps fuelled by high-focus high-octane curiosity. My motto is "being insatiably curious can be curiously satisfying."

My three favorite questions are “Why?”, “What if?" and “Does it work?”

For the past three years I have worked as an Advertising, Business and Innovation strategist. The problems I was solving initially seemed interesting, but then I was hit with a new problem - the problems were getting easier and easier. After unleashing MoneySupermarket's bootilicious Dave upon the world, I decided to call it quits as an Advertising Strategist. For a bit of fun and to buy some time whilst I figured out where I could find more difficult problems to solve, I worked with Charlie Brooker on his 2015 Wipe. 

Having emerged relatively unscathed from the Makers Academy bootcamp, I'm now looking for my first role as a Junior Developer. I hope to work with others who are evangelical about clean code, TDD and pair programming, perhaps whilst picking up C# and C++.

## What To Check Out On My Github

#### LocalHost 

A webapp that connects tourists to locals willing to show them around their hood. 
Check it out here: http://local-host.herokuapp.com/

Built using:
- Angular front-end
- Google Maps API Wizardry
- Rails back-end

#### Opposing Views

We found that many people would rather read news articles that reinforce their view of the world rather than challenge it. And so, we created a webapp that helps people to challenge their point of view by recommending news articles from news sources that have the opposite political leanining to those they have been reading. 

How it works:
It parses URLs that the user has read recently, extracting the news sources they have read articles from as well as frequent topic keywords. Through some back-end algorithmic crunching, we find a news source to suggest along with the top topic keyword to ensure that, for example, if you have been reading a lot of Daily Mail articles about immigration, you are connected to a Guardian article on immigration to balance your point of view. 

Built Using:
- Angular
- Webhose API (to find news articles)
- Rails back-end

## Things I can do (other than code)

## "Strategy"

Whatever "strategy" is, people were willing to pay me to do it. I'm good at spotting an opportunity and plotting the best route to seize upon it. 

#### Where I did "Strategy"

**Redscout London** (July to September 2015)    
*Freelance Innovation Strategist*
Developing new business proposals that led to winning global pieces of business, Godiva and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Developing Boots’ entire own-brand portfolio architecture and innovation framework. Developing research and innovation process for Time Delay.

**Traces App** (May to July 2015)    
*Freelance Business Development and Strategy*
Feeding in on business development strategy, such as opportunities to monetize the platform and how to acquire users. Identifying business development opportunities, such as trade shows, PR contacts and brand and agency partnerships. Creating sales funnels and following through on opportunities. Streamlining user experience and brainstorming potential developments for the app at each new release.

**Mother London** (July 2014 to May 2015)   
*Strategist* 
Boots: Contributed insight and research to Boots’ brand repositioning and restatement campaign. Formulated strategy for this year’s Christmas campaign. Reassessed their value, CSR and food propositions. Independently handled all tactical briefs and created a weekly news mail-out for the client.
MoneySupermarket.com: Contributed to campaign and amplification strategy, creative development and effectiveness assessment for Epic Strut. Formulated new strategy for 2015 to help drive consideration rather than awareness. I worked closely with the Head of Social Media to formulate integrated campaign amplification strategy and post-campaign analysis through social listening. Wrote weekly mail outs to strategy team, contributed to agency PR activities and performed deeper dive ad hoc research tasks for Mother’s other clients, such as Hovis, No.7, PG Tips, Stella Artois and (of course) pitched relentlessly!

**Saatchi & Saatchi** (June 2014 to July 2014)   
*Graduate Strategist* 
Worked on EE and any tasks that came my way. Regrettably, I was poached by Mother after 3 weeks, after also turning down an offer to join JWT’s Account Planning Graduate Scheme.

#### Pieces of Paper (for Proof)

**IPA Effectiveness - Distinction** (June 2015)   
Normally reserved for Strategists with 5 years experience in Advertising, I took the test and surprised myself with the result. 

## "Ideas"

Whatever "ideas" are, apparently I have a lot of them (sometimes they're good). I'm pre-disposed to flexing my creative muscle. I enjoy a brainstorm and bouncing off other people to really push the limits of what an "idea" is (whatever an "idea" is anyway).  

#### Where I Came Up With "Ideas"

**Charlie Brooker's 2015 Wipe, House of Tomorrow, Zeppotron, Endemol Shine** (October 2015 to January 2016)   
*Production Team, Archivist and Logger (a.k.a First Line Funny Filter)* 
My job was to find the funnies in the news to present to Charlie for his satricial and acerbic commentary. It's not always the easiest job - the news isn't always hilarious. It involved being creative about how you could arrange clips and having a good eye for comedy. 

#### Pieces of Paper (for Proof)

**Foundation Diploma Fine Art - Merit** (September 2008 to July 2009)   
*Chelsea School of Art, University of The Arts London* 
I thought this would be more worthwhile than a gap year in East Asia. I was right. 

## Education

## Learning To Code

#### Makers Academy (January - April 2016)
